     Only the answer is correct to turn off the alarm. If the answer is wrong, the alarm will always sound, and then you will change the question for you to answer. 

     I am not a normal alarm clock. My goal is to wake up your potential dreams and let your potential break out.

     Get rid of the boring morning as always, still worry about not coming up? Let it start happy with you every day and  painful day.
